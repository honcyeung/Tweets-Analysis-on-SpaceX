# Tweets Analysis on SpaceX

The CEO of SpaceX, Elon Musk, is very active on the social media Twitter. Hence many of the people who are interested in his company SpaceX are also active on Twitter. I would like to study more about people's reactions on SpaceX on twitter to find out how people feel and think about this company, providing possible insights in any business opportunities in this unicorn.
